Special instruction: 

All of our stored procedures for queries are written in procedures.sql. 
Please use the following mysql command to successfully run the stored procedures: 

mysql -h dbase.cs.jhu.edu -u StaffUsername -D DBName -p < procedures.sql

We utilized CanvasJS, so we havenâ€™t implemented user access control.
